        <h2>Whats this site even about?</h2>
        <p>Nothing much, It's just another main site i've been making. Thats all.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Why another main site? Can't you just stick with one?</h2>
        <p>Sometimes, trying to make something small a active thing wont go well at times. Thats why i sometimes just make a new one when the one im working on does not go well or just breaks.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Who the darn are you then?</h2>
        <p>Someone who has made a lot of images before. I mean, alot.</p>
        <p>I'm also someone who is mostly quiet at times, so expect me to not be that chatty from time to time.</p>
